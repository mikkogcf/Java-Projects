Cloud-topped and splendid, dominating all The little lesser hills which compass thee, Thou standest, bright with April’s buoyancy,Yet holding Winter in some shaded wallOf stern, steep rock; and startled by the call Of Spring, thy trees flush with expectancy And cast a cloud of crimson, silently,Above thy snowy crevices where fall Pale shrivelled oak leaves, while the snow beneath Melts at their phantom touch. Another yearIs quick with import. Such each year has been. Unmoved thou watchest all, and all bequeath Some jewel to thy diadem of power,Thou pledge of greater majesty unseen.
